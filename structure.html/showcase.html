                    <H2>PORTFOLIO WEBSITE</H2>
                    <p>This website itself is a major highlight of my creative work. Built completely with HTML and CSS,
                        it reflects my understanding of layout structuring, typography, responsiveness, and design
                        harmony. Every section, from navigation to footer, is hand-coded—without any JavaScript or
                        libraries—proving how much can be done using just the fundamentals.
                        Through this project, I explored real-time use of Flexbox, media queries for screen sizes, and
                        aesthetic color combinations to create a smooth, scrollable experience. It represents not just
                        my skills, but also my growth, passion, and increasing confidence in front-end design practices.

                    <H2>PRINTABLES (Online stationary business)</H2>
                    <p>In the printables segment of my work, I focused on designing a wide range of stationery products
                        that are both functional and visually appealing. I created planners, calendars, notepads,
                        stickers, and other printable items with attention to layout, usability, and aesthetics. Each
                        design was thoughtfully crafted to bring clarity and joy to everyday planning tasks. Through
                        experimenting with color palettes, typography, and layout structures, I developed products that
                        not only serve practical needs but also reflect creativity and personal expression. This
                        experience allowed me to explore my design sensibility and understand how visual organization
                        impacts user experience.</p>

                    <H2>RISTAURA(Online jwellery brand)</H2>
                    <p> At RistAura, I played a key role in shaping the brand’s visual and content presence. From
                        planning and executing photoshoots to coordinating with models, I helped bring each product to
                        life through storytelling. I wrote scripts for product videos that highlighted the unique
                        qualities of the bracelets, ensuring they resonated with viewers. Alongside this, I created
                        engaging Instagram content—curating stories, shooting and editing reels, writing captions, and
                        designing posters aligned with the brand’s message. This experience deepened my understanding of
                        how visuals and copy work together to build a strong and memorable brand identity.
