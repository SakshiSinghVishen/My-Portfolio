                <H2>PORTFOLIO WEBSITE</H2>
                <p>This website itself is a major highlight of my creative work. Built completely with HTML and CSS, it reflects my understanding of layout structuring, typography, responsiveness, and design harmony. Every section, from navigation to footer, is hand-coded—without any JavaScript or libraries—proving how much can be done using just the fundamentals.<br>
Through this project, I explored real-time implementation of Flexbox, media queries for different screen sizes, and aesthetic color combinations to create a smooth, scrollable experience. It represents not just my skills, but also the growth of my passion for front-end design.</p>

                <H2>PRINTABLES (Online stationary business)</H2>
                <p>In the printables segment of my work, I focused on designing a wide range of stationery products that are both functional and visually appealing. I created planners, calendars, notepads, stickers, and other printable items with attention to layout, usability, and aesthetics. Each design was thoughtfully crafted to bring clarity and joy to everyday planning tasks. Through experimenting with color palettes, typography, and layout structures, I developed products that not only serve practical needs but also reflect creativity and personal expression. This experience allowed me to explore my design sensibility and understand how visual organization impacts user experience.

                <H2>RISTAURA(Online jwellery brand)</H2>
                <p> At RistAura, I played a key role in shaping the brand’s visual and content presence. From planning and executing photoshoots to coordinating with models, I was involved in bringing each product to life through thoughtful storytelling. I wrote scripts for product videos that highlighted the unique qualities of the bracelets, ensuring they resonated with the audience. Alongside this, I created engaging Instagram content—curating stories,making reels from shooting to editing, writing captions, and designing posters that aligned with the brand’s aesthetic and message. This experience deepened my understanding of how visuals and words work together to build a consistent and compelling brand identity.
